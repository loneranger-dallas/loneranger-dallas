## I believe...

* That to have a friend, a man must be one.

* That all men are created equal and that everyone has within himself the power to make this a better world.

* That God put the firewood there but that every man must gather and light it himself.

* In being prepared physically, mentally, and morally to fight when necessary for that which is right.

* That a man should make the most of what equipment he has.

* That "This government, of the people, by the people and for the people" shall live always.

* That men should live by the rule of what is best for the greatest number.

* That sooner or later...somewhere...somehow...we must settle with the world and make payment for what we have taken.

* That all things change but truth, and that truth alone, lives on forever.

* In my Creator, my country, my fellow man.
